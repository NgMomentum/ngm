	<div>
		UI-Router Visualizer is used to monitor the state tree and transitions when using UI-Router 1.0+.
	</div>

	<p>
		This script is used to augment your apps with two components:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				State Visualizer: Visualize your UI-Router state tree, showing the active state and
				its active ancestors (green nodes)
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clicking a state will transition to that state.</li>
				<li>If your app is large, state trees can be collapsed by double-clicking a state.</li>
				<li>Supports different layouts and zoom.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Transition Visualizer: A list of each transition (from one state to another)
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Color coded Transition status (success/error/ignored/redirected)</li>
				<li>Hover over a Transition to show which states were entered/exited, or retained during the transition.</li>
				<li>Click the Transition to see details (parameter values and resolve data)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
