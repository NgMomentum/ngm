	<div data-ng-ignore>

		<p>
			Here are some interesting demo's of common AngularJS widgets using NgMomentum as the
			controlling script. The main difference between NgMomentum and AngularJS is the ability
			to load code "as needed" instead of having to load all code at page load.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using MobileSiteOS also allows the ease of loading JavaScript, HTML and CSS as modules. Most important, MSOS
			modules call their own dependencies. You don't have to keep track of dependency chains. Complex dependency
			managment is handled seemlessly in the background, unlike other module loading scripts.
