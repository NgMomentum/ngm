		<h2>AngularJS Material via NgMomentum</h2>

		<p>
			These demo pages highlight the use of NgMomentum (NgM) and MobileSiteOS (MSOS) as the
			mechanism to load individual, near standard AngularJS Material v1.1.10 component
			modules. Standard AngularJS Material is typically loaded in one shot, as a single
			file, including templates. Not very efficient if you are only using a few components
			for any given website. And the framework file is not small. NgM Material however,
			loads major components "on demand". Only loading the one's you need, when you need them.
		</p>

		<h4>NgM Material Base Code</h4>

		<p>
			The base NgM Material file includes the following AngularJS Material specific injectables.
			These are commonly used injected objects which are frequently required by many other
			NgM Material components. This file is only 46kB uncompressed. The non-component specific
			base CSS file is only 11kB uncompressed. It is important to note, that duplicate CSS code
			to Bootstrap-UI (v3.3.7) and Normalize.css (v3.0.3) has been removed.

		<h4>NgM Dependency Managment</h4>

		<p>
			Using NgM and MSOS with our NgM Material base and component files
			allows loading almost all component JavaScript, HTML and CSS as modules. This
			modular concept impacts initial script loading times significantly, while also
			allowing a more diverse use of typical AngularJS framework components.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most important, MSOS configured modules call their own dependencies. Once a
			MSOS module is defined, you don't have to keep track of dependency chains and
			component specific CSS files. Complex dependency managment is handled at the
			module level, unlike other module loading scripts. Thus NgM Material component
			modules and dependencies are loaded only once, as needed. Only missing dependencies
			are loaded in future NgM Material component calls.
