		<h2>AngularJS Bootstrap-UI via NgMomentum</h2>

		<p>
			These demo pages highlight the use of NgMomentum (NgM) and MobileSiteOS (MSOS) as the
			mechanism to load individual, near standard AngularJS Bootstrap-UI v2.5.0 component
			modules. Standard AngularJS Bootstrap-UI is typically loaded in one shot, as a single
			file, including templates. Not very efficient if you are only using a few components
			for any given website. And the framework file is not small. NgM however, loads major
			components "on demand". Only loading the one's you need, when you need them.
		</p>

		<h4>NgM Bootstrap-UI Base Code</h4>

		<p>
			The base NgM Bootstrap-UI file includes the following modules. These are relatively small,
			commonly used files which are frequent dependencies for other Bootstrap-UI components.
			Only 36kB uncompressed.
		</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.collapse</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.position</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.debounce</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.tabindex</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.isClass</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.stackedMap</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">ng.bootstrap.ui.multiMap</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>NgM Dependency Managment</h4>

		<p>
			Using NgM and MSOS with our NgM Bootstrap-UI base and component files
			allows loading almost all component JavaScript, HTML and CSS as modules. This
			modular concept impacts initial script loading times significantly, while also
			allowing a more diverse use of typical AngularJS framework components.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most important, MSOS configured modules call their own dependencies. Once a
			MSOS module is defined, you don't have to keep track of dependency chains and
			component specific CSS files. Complex dependency managment is handled at the
			module level, unlike other module loading scripts. Thus NgM Bootstrap-UI component
			modules and dependencies are loaded only once, as needed. Only missing dependencies
			are loaded in future NgM Bootstrap-UI component calls.
