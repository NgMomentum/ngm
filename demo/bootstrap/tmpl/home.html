				NgMomentum is a modified version of AngularJS. It retains all the basic goodness of standard
				AngularJS, but is designed specifically for client-side browser execution. NgMomentum (NgM) is
				coded as an AngularJS compatible layer on top of our MobileSiteOS framework. MobileSiteOS (MSOS)
				features "lazy" module loading, and bundles UnderscoreJS and Modernizr in the base script. MSOS
				and NgM also require jQuery as a hard dependency.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal for NgM was to add "lazy" AngularJS module loading and to remove as much duplicate code
				as possible from AngularJS. Equivalent UnderscoreJS, Modernizr and jQuery functions are used in
				NgM where possible. That is, previous AngularJS code which was duplicated by UnderscoreJS,
				Modernizr and/or jQuery, was removed from standard AngularJS.
			<p>	
			</p>
				The result, NgM functions like standard AngularJS, with one major exception. MobileSiteOS can't
				utilize AngularJS's self bootstrapping feature due to MSOS module loading verification and execution
				timing. In order to use "lazy" module loading, bootstrapping must be called via a MSOS runtime
				function at the end of MSOS code processing.
			</p>

				The NgM derivation of AngularJS has also been cleaned up a bit to try and remove some of the more
				"ambiguous" style of coding that was used. This was initially done as an exercise into understanding
				exactly how AngularJS goes about doing what it does. Extensive debugging code was also added for the
				same reason. Other than for improvement, the intent was to clarify and not change basic operations.
				As such, there are also many small attempts at improving the debugging and speed of NgM over the
				standard AngularJS script.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given NgM's focus on client side execution, we also decided to include the following independent modules
				as standard in NgMomentum. Building in ngAnimate also has the added benefit of reducing overall code size.
